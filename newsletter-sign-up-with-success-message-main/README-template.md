## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-Being new to using javascript I have a better grasp on using functions to complete a task. Such as when the submit button is pushed, whether the input is correct or not.

-Having more control over my CSS edits. Whether that is styling or trying to make sure my flexbox or grid is accurate and complete.

-I learned better how to access styles and how methods tie into manipulating the DOM

### Continued development

In future projects I would like to focus on implementing more complex Javascript and get more efficient in CSS
